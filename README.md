Config Brew

isl@0.18 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

For compilers to find isl@0.18 you may need to set:
      export LDFLAGS="-L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.18/lib"
      export CPPFLAGS="-I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.18/include"
